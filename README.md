# e-Receipt
1. Items and prices are top secret data, encrypted with an external program, decrypted on input and evaluated to be the variable value:
```
var x = eval(decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));
```
2. I used Javascript to display the HTML elements' values (onload), using the for-loop.
3. Data were stored in the two dimensional array:
```
var x = [['a', numberOfA], ['b', numberOfB
```
